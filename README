maildirlearn helps you training your bogofilter installation. It works fine on
the local machine (i.e. you’re reading mail on your server) as well as remote
(i.e. you’re syncing your mail with mbsync/via IMAP).

There are two versions available: The first one is written in Python and the
second one in C. Obviously the latter is more efficient while the first one is
not vulnerable to buffer overflow bugs.

Both versions currently work for a single user/one maildir only. The mailbox
format is not supported.
